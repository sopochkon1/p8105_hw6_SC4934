# Problem 1

# Problem 2

## import and tidy

```{r results = "hide", message=FALSE}
homicide = 
read_csv(
  "data/homicide-data.csv"
) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    state = case_when(city == "Tulsa" ~ "OK", TRUE ~ as.character(state)),
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = case_when(disposition == "Closed by arrest" | disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~                        1, disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0 ),
    victim_age = as.integer(victim_age)) %>% 
  subset(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO") %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
  
```


## Regression 

```{r results = "hide", message = FALSE}
baltimore = homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

fit_logistic = 
  baltimore %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

fit_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>% 
  select(term, estimate, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3) 

exp(confint(fit_logistic))

```

The estimate is -1.037. 
The adjsuted odds ratio is 0.355, and the confidence interval is (0.267, 0.468). 

Homicides in which the victim is Male are substantially less likely to be resolved compared 
to homicides in which the victim is female, keeping all other variables fixed.
