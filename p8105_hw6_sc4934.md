# Problem 1

  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",

# Problem 2

## import and tidy

``` r
homicide = 
read_csv(
  "data/homicide-data.csv"
) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = case_when(disposition == "Closed by arrest"  ~ 1, disposition == "Open/No arrest" | disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0 ),
    victim_age = as.integer(victim_age)) %>% 
  subset(city_state != "Tulsa, AL", city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO") %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

## Regression

``` r
baltimore = homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

fit_logistic = 
  baltimore %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

fit_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>% 
  select(term, OR, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3) 

exp(confint(fit_logistic))
```

The adjsuted odds ratio is 0.426, and the confidence interval is (0.324,
0.557).

Homicides in which the victim is Male are substantially less likely to
be resolved compared to homicides in which the victim is female, keeping
all other variables fixed.

## Each city Regression

``` r
city_logistic = 
  homicide %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    results = map(data, ~ glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())), 
    results = map(results, broom::tidy, conf.int = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(cols = results) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         conf.low = exp(conf.low),
         conf.high = exp(conf.high)) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, conf.low, conf.high)
```

## Plot

``` r
city_logistic %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR, color = city_state)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = as.numeric(conf.low), ymax = as.numeric(conf.high))) +
  labs(
    x = "City, State",
    y = "OR (CI)",
    title = "OR and CI for each City"
  ) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
